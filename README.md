# Tranzit-Ride Operations SQL Analysis

This SQL task is an **extension** of my [**Tranzit-Ride Operations Dashboard**](https://github.com/favy-codez/Tranzit-Ride-Operations-Dashboard) project.  It focuses on analyzing the **drivers**, **trips**, and **riders** data using SQL to uncover insights about ride activities, driver performance, and operational patterns.

---

## Overview
The goal of this analysis is to explore ridesharing operations, monitor performance, and reveal trends that help improve efficiency and profitability.  
Queries were written to analyze relationships between drivers, riders, and trips.

---

## Datasets Used
- **`trz.drivers`** – contains driver details such as rating, signup date, home area, and vehicle information.  
- **`trz.trips`** – includes trip-level data such as fare, distance, and pickup/drop-off areas.  
- **`trz.riders`** – holds rider information such as tier, home area, and payment preferences.

## SQL Concepts Applied
- Filtering and sorting records  
- Aggregating data using `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, and `AVG()`  
- Data grouping and classification using `CASE`  
- Combining data with `JOIN`  
- Extracting time-based insights with `YEAR()`, `MONTH()`, and `DATENAME()`
